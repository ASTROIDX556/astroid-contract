//! Standardized cross-cutting events.
//!
//! Per PRD Doc 7 the backend subscribes to a fixed set of protocol events to
//! drive analytics, notifications and audit logs. These helpers publish those
//! events with a consistent topic/data schema so that every contract emits them
//! identically. Contracts may also publish additional, contract-specific events
//! directly; these are the shared "standard" set.
//!
//! Two layers are provided:
//!
//! 1. **Typed [`ContractEvent`]** — a single `ContractEvent` enum that is the
//!    canonical, structured schema consumed by off-chain indexers. Each variant
//!    publishes under one topic equal to the variant symbol (e.g. `WalletCreated`)
//!    with a strongly-typed payload, so consumers get stable, self-describing
//!    events across every contract.
//! 2. **Tuple-topic helpers** — convenience functions publishing the legacy
//!    `(Symbol category, Symbol action)` tuple topics, retained for backwards
//!    compatibility with existing dashboards.
//!
//! The two layers are emitted together on key state transitions so neither
//! existing nor new consumers break.
